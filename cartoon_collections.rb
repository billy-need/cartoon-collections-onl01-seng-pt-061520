# and find the first string the matches one of the following
# cheese strings: "cheddar", "gouda", or "camembert"
#
# Given an array that looks like: ["shoe", "rope", "gouda"],
# the value "gouda" should be returned by "find_the_cheese".
#
# Given an array that looks like: ["cheddar", "rope", "pie"],
# the value "cheddar" should be returned by "find_the_cheese".
#
# If the array of items contains no cheese, then "find_the_cheese"
# should return nil.

# Assume that all strings will be lower-case.
